Risk Identification 
#################################

Phase 1. Identifying the risk 
---------------------------------------  
  -  Business objectives are set and agreed during planning cycle (long term plans)
  -  Analysis of the operating environement enables identification of the risks that could impact  on the delivery of business plans
     - Ways :
        -  clean sheet reviews
        - regualr management reviews /ad hoc reviews if a change to business environment 
  - Identify risk event , 
  - and conduct a risk assessment whether 
      - furthere analysis is required , 
      - a risk owner is identified and
      - risk is entered into a risk register


Phase 2. identifying the control 
---------------------------------------  
  - Bowtie tool (tool to capture risk information during the risk identification phase )
  - set out the process for establishing the causes and impacts for a risk event and the linkage to controls
      Cause                             -> Risk Event , RIsk Issues ->           Impact 
      Preventative Control   (monitoring)                                 Mitigating Control ( disaster recovery plan)
  - Critical Control => significantly reduces the impact or likelihood of a risk 
  - Control Documentation 
      - developed by control owners of each control 
      - design standard  
          - what needs to be in place or provided for the critical control to be effective 
      - operating standard 
          - the activities or tasks that occur to ensure that the control operates as designed 
      - verification approach 
          - method and strategy to obtain assurance on the contorl health , using various methods as evidence 

Phase 3. including these risks in a risk register 
---------------------------------------  
- Risk Register
  - RM tool to record details for identified risk
      - risk ratings
      - nature of the risk
      - owner
      - manager
      - mitigation measures

################################
Risk Analysis
#################################
- Risk Calculation 
  - Likelihood 
      - Rare (less than once in 15 yrs) 
      - Unlikely ( at least once in 10 yrs)
      - Possible ( at least once in 5 yrs)
      - Likely ( 1-2 times per year)
      - Almost certain ( more than 3 times per year)

  - Impact 
      - consequence of a risk event in financial temrs or in the context of other factors that affect both business and society
      - might affect health, safety and the law,, environment 
      - each risk will have mutiple impacts of different degrees

  - Risk Rating 
      - = Likelihood X Impact 

################################
Risk Evaluation and Risk Treatment 
#################################

  - Compare the risk analysis outputs against risk criteria to understand where risk is tolerable 
  - Process :
      - Conducting the periodic risk assessments (annually minimum)
      - Assesing the risks againsrt a rating shceme ("Well controlled, Require improvement, uncontrolled)
      - Justify the Risk rating 
        - control assessment result
        - actual control failure /control failutre that resulted in a similar risk
        - internal audit findings
        - external audit findings
        - management reviews
      - Assessing risks against risk tolerance 
          - tolerability 
              - measure of acceptance of the risk level remaining after taking account of the effectiveness of controls and mitigating actions 
          - if risk is not tolerable, risk owner must raise a risk rectification issue and implement remedication tasks to reduce the residual risk
-------------------------------------------------
Reducing Risk
    - Risk treatment 
        - action taken to modify the identified risk to a acceptabole level 
        - Ways :
                - Transfer  (to third party (insurance, outsourcing)
                - Mitigate  (taking action to reducde the likelihood of an event , but not avoiding the risk)
                - Avoid 
        - Accept the risk (Risk retention) to achive a profit
        - Risk Treatment chart 
-------------------------------------------------
Controls To Treat Risk
  - Hierarchy of controls (from most effective to least effective)
    - Elimination (is this step critical?)
    - Replace (bots?)
    - Engineering controls (implement a system control validation data entry)
    - Admin controls  (establish policies and procedures , provide training )

  - Key Controls (alone or conjunction with other controls)
    - Elements to be considered when determine key control 
        - the only barrier/layers of protection available ?
        - can it be used to prevent /migitate multiple risk causes/impacts? 
        - independent form other controls?
        - a single activity ?
        - used to detect /prevent escalation of the event? 
    - To identify effective key controls :
        - 1. identify causes , then controls which link to the causes. When all causes have been covered, critical controls are determined based on criteria in the RM policy
        - 2. Document the control design standard, operating standard, verification approach . Obtain approval from risk owner
        - 3. Assess the key controls for effectiveness through the test plans. use feedback to circle back and review
    - Control Effectiveness ratings 
        - to calculate the control design and implementation effectiveness for managing the risks
