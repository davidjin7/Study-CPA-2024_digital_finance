Risk Identification 
#################################

## Phase 1. Identifying the risk 
---------------------------------------  
  -  Business objectives are set and agreed during planning cycle (long term plans)
  -  Analysis of the operating environement enables identification of the risks that could impact  on the delivery of business plans
     - Ways :
        -  clean sheet reviews
        - regualr management reviews /ad hoc reviews if a change to business environment 
  - Identify risk event , 
  - and conduct a risk assessment whether 
      - furthere analysis is required , 
      - a risk owner is identified and
      - risk is entered into a risk register


## Phase 2. identifying the control 
---------------------------------------  
  - Bowtie tool (tool to capture risk information during the risk identification phase )
  - set out the process for establishing the causes and impacts for a risk event and the linkage to controls
      Cause                             -> Risk Event , RIsk Issues ->           Impact 
      Preventative Control   (monitoring)                                 Mitigating Control ( disaster recovery plan)
  - Critical Control => significantly reduces the impact or likelihood of a risk 
  - Control Documentation 
      - developed by control owners of each control 
      - design standard  
          - what needs to be in place or provided for the critical control to be effective 
      - operating standard 
          - the activities or tasks that occur to ensure that the control operates as designed 
      - verification approach 
          - method and strategy to obtain assurance on the contorl health , using various methods as evidence 

## Phase 3. including these risks in a risk register 
---------------------------------------  
- Risk Register
  - RM tool to record details for identified risk
      - risk ratings
      - nature of the risk
      - owner
      - manager
      - mitigation measures

################################
Risk Analysis
#################################
- Risk Calculation 
  - Likelihood 
      - Rare (less than once in 15 yrs) 
      - Unlikely ( at least once in 10 yrs)
      - Possible ( at least once in 5 yrs)
      - Likely ( 1-2 times per year)
      - Almost certain ( more than 3 times per year)

  - Impact 
      - consequence of a risk event in financial temrs or in the context of other factors that affect both business and society
      - might affect health, safety and the law,, environment 
      - each risk will have mutiple impacts of different degrees

  - Risk Rating 
      - = Likelihood X Impact 

################################
Risk Evaluation and Risk Treatment 
#################################

  - Compare the risk analysis outputs against risk criteria to understand where risk is tolerable 
  - Process :
      - Conducting the periodic risk assessments (annually minimum)
      - Assesing the risks againsrt a rating shceme ("Well controlled, Require improvement, uncontrolled)
      - Justify the Risk rating 
        - control assessment result
        - actual control failure /control failutre that resulted in a similar risk
        - internal audit findings
        - external audit findings
        - management reviews
      - Assessing risks against risk tolerance 
          - tolerability 
              - measure of acceptance of the risk level remaining after taking account of the effectiveness of controls and mitigating actions 
          - if risk is not tolerable, risk owner must raise a risk rectification issue and implement remedication tasks to reduce the residual risk
-------------------------------------------------
Reducing Risk
    - Risk treatment 
        - action taken to modify the identified risk to a acceptabole level 
        - Ways :
                - Transfer  (to third party (insurance, outsourcing)
                - Mitigate  (taking action to reducde the likelihood of an event , but not avoiding the risk)
                - Avoid 
        - Accept the risk (Risk retention) to achive a profit
        - Risk Treatment chart 
-------------------------------------------------
Controls To Treat Risk
  - Hierarchy of controls (from most effective to least effective)
    - Elimination (is this step critical?)
    - Replace (bots?)
    - Engineering controls (implement a system control validation data entry)
    - Admin controls  (establish policies and procedures , provide training )

  - Key Controls (alone or conjunction with other controls)
    - Elements to be considered when determine key control 
        - the only barrier/layers of protection available ?
        - can it be used to prevent /migitate multiple risk causes/impacts? 
        - independent form other controls?
        - a single activity ?
        - used to detect /prevent escalation of the event? 
    - To identify effective key controls :
        - 1. identify causes , then controls which link to the causes. When all causes have been covered, critical controls are determined based on criteria in the RM policy
        - 2. Document the control design standard, operating standard, verification approach . Obtain approval from risk owner
        - 3. Assess the key controls for effectiveness through the test plans. use feedback to circle back and review
    - Control Effectiveness ratings 
        - to calculate the control design and implementation effectiveness for managing the risks
            - Effective, Adequate, Inadequate

-------------------------------------------------
Business Continuity Phase and Disaster Recovery Plans (BCP)
    - encompasses mitigating controls for significant risks that upon occurrence could interrupt the business for an extended period time 
    - Risk owner to decide whether BCP is required
    - RO develop, implement , test and maintain BCP to ensure the approriate resources (plan,procedures/facilities ,equipemnet, training) are available in case of an inccident 
    - Disaster RAecovery Plan 
        - documented approach that details how an organisation can return to work after an unplanned outage or incident 
          - to perform a business inmpact assessment BIA frist to establish key objectives for recovery 
            - network, cloud, virtual, data centre disaster recovery plan

################################
Risk Monitoring and action 
#################################

- a system of ongoing review that is capable of responding promptly to new risks and changes to existing risks 
- Objecvtives 
    - provide a system of ongoing revierw of risk to management
    - deliver the status of organisation risk profile to leadership team
    - report to executive management and risk and audit commitee
- all RM activities to be documented and maintained in risk register 
- Why doing so :
      - info and data may be referred or relied upon in future RM activities 
      - provide evidence of organisation RM activities , and provide background info to support the reasons decisions were made
      - assist with any insurance , legal claim and protect organisation and its emploees 
- Risk Monitoring and reporting requirement plan
  - Organisation risk profile  (six month)
  - risk register (internal audit and governance teams ) (six months)
  - risk input into two-five-year plan ( risk review is conducted and incorporate into business planning and budgetting process) (Annully)
  - executive management reporting ( monthly to CEO reporting)
  - leadership team meetings (monthly , qtrly, bi-aanual)
  - head of functions meetings ( monthly,quatertly)

################################
ISO 31000 Monitoring and Review Processes
#################################

- Expects organations to plan monitoring and review processes into all RM process stages
  - Control Validation   
       - risk controls to prevent , detect , correct risk
       - control to occur at all levels of organisation and may be physical, logical , managerial, involve process or policy controls 
       - done periodically to make sure controls are working 
       - carry out an audit
       - documents resulting from validating the controls , resources and personnel required , timeline for completion 
 - Audit 
       - identifdy the risks and check that intentions of RM strategy are being carried out 
       - look whether controls or policies have been implemented correctly
       - monitor present situation and identify how better manage risk in future 
- KRI 
      - indicators that are translated into metrics for easier consideration 
      - provide how likely future adverse impacts will be 
      - leading KRI (focus on predicting future outcomes )
      - lagging KRI (focus on previous outcomes )
      - define at what points risk needs attention or intervention 
      - inform better risk assessments and detects early warnings of emerging risks 
      - identify trends of areas 
      - most effective when risks are measurable , trackable  predictable and informative 
      - requires determining the threshold at which action to mitigate risk is triggered 
      - serve as a proactive approach to RM 

################################
Monitoring Risk using risk triggers
#################################

- Risk changes over time and this change can affect compliance 
- Risk triggers are a way of staying on top of changes and staying compliant 
- responsive to risk 
- RT help to monitor for any unknown risk and re-evaluate their RM 

- Type of Risk Trigger :
      - Incident/near miss event 
          - incidicate that controls are failing or that risk is not managed well
      - Audit Findings 
          - highlights issues with control environment or identify when risks arent being well managed from an independent source
      - Stakeholder.business impact analysis 
          - bank closure on branches , impactr staff morale
          - bank used AI to target potential customers. may lead to biased results 
      - Operational risk/organisational change 
          - may affect other risk profiles /underlying control enviroment (Examnple : move local server to cloud)
      - IT change management 
          - large impact on system 
          - change in system to automated and affect the whole business processes 
      - Privavy impact analysis 
          - security and privavy of data 
          - health insurance collect health data from various sources, (need to k now if what they intended to do is in accordance with privavy best practises and regulations
      - Changes to risk profile (PESTLE analysis)
          - example : aviation company changes in safetly regulations and standards 
                      lending company is required to undertstand and conform to the buy now pay later legislation and changes in competitive landscapre
